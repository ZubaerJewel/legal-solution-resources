                            The phrase “Legal Method” consists of two words, which are “legal” and “method”. The word
                            “legal” implies things relating or pertaining to law while “method” means a way or procedure
                            of doing something in an organized and planned manner. Legal method can therefore be
                            defined as the way and manner of doing things relating to law in the society. It is also the study
                            of how lawyers, judges act according to law so as to achieve its objectives in the society. Thus,
                            legal method is the study of law and the various methods, processes, and procedure in which
                            law can be effectively used to meet the need of the individual and the state. Simply put, it is an
                            organized way of doing things in law.

            This is understood in terms of the right to vote and be voted for. This has generated democratic
            principles and it’s believed that it is the aim of the law to institutionalize democratic procedures.
            Political freedom is another way of man actualizing his right of participation in governance or
            in issues that concern or affect him. Political freedom has also led to different agitations
            especially the struggle for independence in a modern state. One of the results of the quest for
            Political freedom is the universal declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) which is one of the
            most important documents of the United Nations. </p>

                There are many reasons why people obey the law. Some people obey the law simply because
it is good to do so or it is necessary to act in conformity with the law. Law has elements of
coercion. In this case people who chose to disobey the law are usually sanctioned. Such people
therefore obey the law for the fear of sanction .</p>

                            Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, and Grid for two-dimensional layouts.
                            The approach of CSS Grid is the layout first, while the Flexbox approach is primarily the content.
                            The Flexbox layout is best suited to application components and small-scale layouts,
                             while the Grid layout is designed for larger-scale layouts that are not linear in design..

                                    A box in CSS consists of a content area, which is where any text, images, or other HTML elements are displayed. 
                                    This is optionally surrounded by padding, a border, and a margin, on one or more sides.
                                    The box model describes how these elements work together to create a box as displayed by CSS.

                                 Semantic HTML tags are tags that define the meaning of the content they contain. For example, tags like <header>, <article>, and <footer> are semantic HTML tags. They clearly indicate the role
                                 of the content they contain. On the other hand, tags like and <span> are typical examples of non-semantic HTML elements.
